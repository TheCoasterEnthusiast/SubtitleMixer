1
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:15,319
The heart...

2
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:24,343
... for Smoke Frog.

3
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:25,619
Thank you.

4
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,487
This liver for Curl Nose.

5
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:35,475
Thank you.

6
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:41,299
Cocoa Leaf...

7
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:42,577
... the ears.

8
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:43,956
Thank you.

9
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:48,206
And for you Blunted...

10
00:03:50,904 --> 00:03:52,431
... the balls.

11
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:56,688
Not this again.

12
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,061
I'm helping you.

13
00:03:58,265 --> 00:03:59,345
Then you eat them!

14
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:01,749
I don't need them.
Neither do the rest of the fellows.

15
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:02,831
Do you fellows?

16
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:03,636
No.

17
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:04,632
Of course not!

18
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:05,907
Sometimes!

19
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:06,900
What do you think?

20
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:08,020
No!

21
00:04:08,088 --> 00:04:08,950
No, no!

22
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:11,220
But how many times does it take?

23
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:13,969
I have eight older sisters
and one brother.

24
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,558
Father took tapir balls all ten times.

25
00:04:56,473 --> 00:04:57,782
Shall I tell him?

26
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:01,940
I'm sorry. The balls are useless.

27
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:05,234
You've never had them?

28
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:07,895
Couldn't tell you what they taste like.

29
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:09,904
None of you?

30
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,386
No, but it's been fun watching you...

31
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:20,974
This was your idea!

32
00:05:23,832 --> 00:05:25,076
Get him off me!

33
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:33,233
Calm down!

34
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:52,824
Why do you let them treat you like this?

35
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:54,765
Be strong.

36
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,758
Where is your pride?

37
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:04,527
It all works... Yes?

38
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:08,977
Yes...

39
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:12,147
... I just can't make children.

40
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:19,824
There is something I will tell you...

41
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,636
... but I warn you, it's very powerful.

42
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:25,971
What do you speak of?

43
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:28,271
The soanzo leaf.

44
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:30,934
The soanzo leaf?

45
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:33,745
From the great marshes in the south...

46
00:06:38,392 --> 00:06:41,294
This is what gave me my ten children.

47
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:49,490
No! No! Wait...

48
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:53,013
You have to rub them on... down there.

49
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,860
Just before you next try.

50
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:58,063
Apply it generously...

51
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,463
I don't know how to thank you.

52
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:09,426
If this works...
maybe she'll stop bothering me.

53
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:10,896
Your wife?

54
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:13,108
No, her mother.

55
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,734
The old hag wants grandchildren.

56
00:07:24,888 --> 00:07:26,382
Give me some meat.

57
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:28,782
Here, work on this...

58
00:07:29,176 --> 00:07:30,932
... pure meat...

59
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,773
... ball breath.

60
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:37,649
What do you want?

61
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,156
What do you want?

62
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:41,330
I am Flint Sky. I have hunted
this forest from the day I came of age.

63
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:46,999
My father hunted this forest
with me and before me.

64
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:50,423
Jaguar Paw, my son.

65
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:52,949
He hunts this forest with me.

66
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:57,773
He will hunt it with his son
after I am gone.

67
00:10:17,113 --> 00:10:18,422
A good catch?

68
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:21,112
Good waters here.

69
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:25,079
The forest gives much here.

70
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:32,791
We ask only to pass through.

71
00:10:33,624 --> 00:10:34,868
Pass.

72
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:42,260
Keep safe as you pass.

73
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:47,247
Let's go.

74
00:11:22,552 --> 00:11:24,624
Our lands were ravaged.

75
00:11:25,464 --> 00:11:27,319
We seek a new beginning.

76
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:35,503
Your lands were ravaged?

77
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:40,656
Yes...

78
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:44,497
We seek a new beginning...

79
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:46,258
Be still.

80
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:47,382
My son!

81
00:11:49,304 --> 00:11:50,514
Be still.

82
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,692
Back to the village.

83
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:33,750
I ask you not to speak
of what you saw in the forest today.

84
00:12:37,496 --> 00:12:39,536
You are troubled.

85
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:41,426
Yes, I am.

86
00:12:57,272 --> 00:13:01,233
Those people in the forest,
what did you see on them?

87
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:02,864
I do not understand.

88
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:05,335
Fear.

89
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:11,352
Deep rotting fear.

90
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:14,351
They were infected by it.

91
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:16,436
Did you see?

92
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:19,024
Fear is a sickness.

93
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:28,049
It will crawl into the soul
of anyone who engages it.

94
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:33,777
It has tainted your peace already.

95
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:39,824
I did not raise you
to see you live with fear.

96
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:43,889
Strike it from your heart.

97
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:46,673
Do not bring it into our village.

98
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:50,673
At first light
we will gather with the elders...

99
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:54,544
... at the sacred hill of our fathers.

100
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:59,380
There we will call on
their spirits to guide us.

101
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:11,729
Oh, here he is!

102
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:13,941
The big lump!

103
00:14:14,744 --> 00:14:16,151
He's useless.

104
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:18,253
He can't do it.

105
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,421
You! Yes you!

106
00:14:22,136 --> 00:14:25,397
With your height and your girth.
You have deceived us.

107
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:27,634
Get inside!

108
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,413
Damn you! Get in there!

109
00:14:34,744 --> 00:14:36,173
Old woman, please.

110
00:14:36,568 --> 00:14:37,496
Move it!

111
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:43,095
You don't work!

112
00:14:45,528 --> 00:14:46,935
What are you laughing about?

113
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:58,894
Give me a grandchild
or I will have you replaced.

114
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,812
Mother, that's enough.

115
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,743
Do not come out until you make a child.

116
00:15:07,352 --> 00:15:08,813
Two would be better!

117
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:09,942
What?

118
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,453
Twins you oaf.

119
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:22,578
Mother.

120
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:27,668
Can you go away?
He says he can't with you sitting there.

121
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:29,397
Just get busy.

122
00:15:30,616 --> 00:15:31,860
Mom...

123
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:37,719
She's gone.

124
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:22,130
Mother, what do you say we should
have at the feast tonight?

125
00:16:22,392 --> 00:16:24,977
I have tapir...
but I also found this boy.

126
00:16:25,656 --> 00:16:26,354
I say boy.

127
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,413
Roasted!

128
00:16:27,672 --> 00:16:30,193
The tapir smells better.
I think it's more fresh.

129
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:32,439
No Dad! No! It's me! It's me!

130
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:35,315
I'll just hang the boy here
in case we change our minds.

131
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:39,410
Wait...

132
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:42,357
That's our Turtles Run.
That's our eldest.

133
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:44,919
Yes it's me. It's your eldest!

134
00:16:45,784 --> 00:16:48,948
In that case, a crush for my eldest...

135
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:54,612
... and a crush for my youngest.

136
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:58,068
Tapir it is.

137
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:02,838
One day, old man!

138
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,587
One day you won't be able
to run anymore!

139
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,583
And a Man sat alone.

140
00:18:26,968 --> 00:18:29,390
Drenched deep in sadness.

141
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:32,755
And all the animals
drew near to him and said:

142
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:37,012
"We do not like to see you so sad...

143
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:42,039
"Ask us for whatever you wish
and you shall have it. "

144
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:47,222
The Man said:
"I want to have good sight. "

145
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:51,634
The vulture replied:
"You shall have mine. "

146
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:57,618
The Man said: "I want to be strong. "

147
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:02,867
The jaguar said:

148
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,958
"You shall be strong like me. "

149
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:15,477
Then the Man said: "I long
to know the secrets of the earth. "

150
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:21,741
The serpent replied:
"I will show them to you. "

151
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:25,964
And so it went with all the animals.

152
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:30,225
And when the Man had
all the gifts that they could give...

153
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:31,984
... he left.

154
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:35,667
Then the owl said to the other animals:

155
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:40,277
"Now the Man knows much
and is able to do many things...

156
00:19:41,336 --> 00:19:44,532
"Suddenly I am afraid. "

157
00:19:47,608 --> 00:19:50,291
The deer said:
"The Man has all that he needs. "

158
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:53,293
"Now his sadness will stop. "

159
00:19:53,912 --> 00:19:55,821
But the owl replied: "No. "

160
00:19:58,391 --> 00:20:01,141
"I saw a hole in the Man...

161
00:20:02,104 --> 00:20:05,716
"Deep like a hunger
he will never fill...

162
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:11,021
"It is what makes him sad
and what makes him want. "

163
00:20:14,168 --> 00:20:17,102
"He will go on taking and taking...

164
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:21,330
"Until one day the World will say:

165
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:26,032
"I am no more
and I have nothing left to give. "

166
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:12,628
Come back to me...

167
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,580
Come back to me.

168
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:48,205
My son is dancing.

169
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:51,887
Your son is happy.

170
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:43,728
What do you want?

171
00:22:59,096 --> 00:23:00,754
Run!

172
00:23:15,672 --> 00:23:19,534
Now that you're up,
can you please kill that dog?

173
00:23:32,151 --> 00:23:34,126
The dog.

174
00:24:58,167 --> 00:24:59,694
Get up! Get up! Now!

175
00:26:12,343 --> 00:26:13,870
Go to the forest.

176
00:26:14,295 --> 00:26:16,051
Run! Do not look back.

177
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:42,547
No! No! I am afraid!

178
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:44,845
Look into my eyes. Look into my eyes.

179
00:26:45,175 --> 00:26:46,190
Be strong...

180
00:26:46,615 --> 00:26:47,663
I am afraid!

181
00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:49,708
Be strong.

182
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:46,579
Tie him up!

183
00:29:01,527 --> 00:29:02,510
Father!

184
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:05,935
The others. I have to help.

185
00:29:07,031 --> 00:29:08,690
No, don't leave us!

186
00:29:08,983 --> 00:29:11,536
I will come back, I promise.

187
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:12,976
Don't you leave!

188
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:14,067
I promise.

189
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:14,996
Stay, please stay.

190
00:29:15,224 --> 00:29:16,303
Father, don't go.

191
00:30:10,615 --> 00:30:11,956
Very nice.

192
00:30:57,047 --> 00:30:58,029
Stop!

193
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:07,730
Tie him up!

194
00:31:11,927 --> 00:31:13,269
I want him alive.

195
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:34,193
Sorry Father.

196
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,357
That's enough!

197
00:32:04,535 --> 00:32:06,226
Stand him up.

198
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:15,215
Move away.

199
00:32:28,503 --> 00:32:30,193
My son.

200
00:32:40,631 --> 00:32:42,354
Don't be afraid.

201
00:33:38,295 --> 00:33:40,662
Almost...

202
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:57,455
... that's your name.

203
00:33:58,423 --> 00:34:01,457
"Almost".

204
00:34:16,695 --> 00:34:19,062
Our life is over.

205
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:25,490
Shame...

206
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:34,384
Shame!

207
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,365
Cowards!

208
00:38:05,302 --> 00:38:06,993
Let's move!

209
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:22,260
We move out now.

210
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:24,021
They are back.

211
00:40:26,934 --> 00:40:28,211
Get up!

212
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:32,277
Heave!

213
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:41,809
Cut Rock, you forgot to duck.

214
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:45,938
Hold still.

215
00:40:55,255 --> 00:40:56,334
Can you see?

216
00:40:58,647 --> 00:40:59,541
Yes.

217
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,714
Get back to your line.

218
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,776
Come with us...

219
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,135
Get up.

220
00:43:05,206 --> 00:43:07,378
Leave him alone, "Almost".

221
00:43:09,463 --> 00:43:11,251
I said get up.

222
00:43:38,646 --> 00:43:40,304
Up, up...

223
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,284
... that's it.

224
00:43:44,342 --> 00:43:45,618
Let's go!

225
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:52,116
This man is a good friend of yours...

226
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,478
Don't worry...

227
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:32,790
I'll take care of them.

228
00:44:35,607 --> 00:44:37,810
They are mine now.

229
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:48,685
Gentle lxchel. Tender mother of mercy.

230
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:55,375
Keep them from harm. Please. Keep them.

231
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:31,341
One more.

232
00:45:54,006 --> 00:45:55,632
Ready?

233
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:55,564
Hold on! Hold on!

234
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,844
Wait...

235
00:47:02,326 --> 00:47:04,050
... let's see what happens.

236
00:47:11,734 --> 00:47:12,596
That's it!

237
00:47:19,542 --> 00:47:20,687
Hurry!

238
00:47:21,622 --> 00:47:23,477
Pull! Be strong!

239
00:47:41,749 --> 00:47:43,505
Yes! You did it!

240
00:47:47,222 --> 00:47:48,815
Good work!

241
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,728
Can you breathe? Good.

242
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:33,171
Wait here.

243
00:49:05,173 --> 00:49:06,766
What's become of my capture?

244
00:49:10,422 --> 00:49:11,797
Dead weight.

245
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,569
He nearly took the rest with him.

246
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:19,375
I let him go.

247
00:49:23,446 --> 00:49:25,104
You. Let him go?

248
00:49:31,894 --> 00:49:35,243
Shall we now do what you want?

249
00:49:39,414 --> 00:49:42,261
Let us try that.

250
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:07,249
Don't let any others go.

251
00:50:13,654 --> 00:50:14,864
Let's move.

252
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,566
Get up "Almost".

253
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:36,044
We don't want to lose you just yet.

254
00:51:24,182 --> 00:51:26,091
Stand up, boy.

255
00:51:34,485 --> 00:51:36,907
You proved yourself today, my son.

256
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:41,234
You're now worthy to stand
with the rest of us.

257
00:51:43,702 --> 00:51:46,123
Thank you Father.

258
00:51:55,766 --> 00:51:57,107
Take it...

259
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:58,992
... it's yours.

260
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:05,454
It has taken many lives.

261
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:18,708
Get some rest.

262
00:52:32,629 --> 00:52:33,742
Resting brothers...

263
00:52:34,005 --> 00:52:37,234
... fathers, mothers, wives.

264
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:42,223
You felt the cold
of this day's early morning.

265
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:47,152
Now you cannot feel
the coldness of its night.

266
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,659
She stopped screaming...

267
00:52:53,782 --> 00:52:56,629
... too long before they returned,
she had stopped screaming.

268
00:52:57,462 --> 00:53:00,015
We saw how she fought them.

269
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:02,770
But in the final moment?

270
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:06,131
If she let them...

271
00:53:08,694 --> 00:53:13,134
... the Goddess of the Scaffold
shows no mercy for the weakness...

272
00:53:15,094 --> 00:53:19,371
Her soul waits for yours
in the shade of the Ceiba Tree.

273
00:53:30,102 --> 00:53:31,727
I need to know.

274
00:53:33,173 --> 00:53:37,778
Before this day's end
I will leave this world.

275
00:53:39,606 --> 00:53:44,843
I will take as many
of these bastard dogs with me as I can.

276
00:53:47,094 --> 00:53:51,698
And I will gladly embrace
the torments of hell...

277
00:53:53,781 --> 00:53:57,010
... if I do not find my Sky Flower there.

278
00:54:03,766 --> 00:54:05,173
Don't rain.

279
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,465
I am walking here.

280
00:55:19,925 --> 00:55:21,867
Keep away, she has the sickness.

281
00:55:46,421 --> 00:55:48,014
Get back!

282
00:56:38,742 --> 00:56:40,782
You fear me?

283
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:44,621
So you should...

284
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:48,531
... all you who are vile.

285
00:56:51,445 --> 00:56:54,828
Would you like to know how you will die?

286
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:05,266
The sacred time is near...

287
00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:11,342
Beware the blackness of day.

288
00:57:14,421 --> 00:57:18,993
Beware the man who brings the jaguar.

289
00:57:21,782 --> 00:57:26,255
Behold him reborn from mud and earth...

290
00:57:27,286 --> 00:57:32,915
For the one he takes you to
will cancel the sky...

291
00:57:34,006 --> 00:57:36,755
... and scratch out the earth.

292
00:57:37,846 --> 00:57:40,049
Scratch you out.

293
00:57:41,269 --> 00:57:43,855
And end your world.

294
00:57:50,165 --> 00:57:53,165
He's with us now.

295
00:57:59,861 --> 00:58:02,578
... day will be like night.

296
00:58:03,093 --> 00:58:07,468
And the man jaguar
will lead you to your end.

297
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:17,712
Where are they taking us?

298
00:59:21,845 --> 00:59:26,067
We tell stories of a place stone-built.

299
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:29,003
What happens there?

300
00:59:29,909 --> 00:59:31,251
I do not know...

301
00:59:32,725 --> 00:59:36,108
... but the earth bleeds.

302
00:59:39,029 --> 00:59:40,851
We are near.

303
01:00:20,854 --> 01:00:22,380
Salvation!

304
01:00:22,965 --> 01:00:25,900
He has the laughing sickness.

305
01:00:26,869 --> 01:00:28,811
He likes you!

306
01:00:31,285 --> 01:00:32,463
Help me!

307
01:00:40,501 --> 01:00:42,257
Save me.

308
01:00:49,845 --> 01:00:51,340
Die like a man.

309
01:03:25,365 --> 01:03:26,412
Welcome back.

310
01:03:27,509 --> 01:03:28,916
Have you been successful?

311
01:03:29,493 --> 01:03:30,540
Ask my son.

312
01:03:32,405 --> 01:03:33,714
How many captives?

313
01:03:33,941 --> 01:03:34,868
Deal with my son.

314
01:03:36,885 --> 01:03:37,900
A fair price.

315
01:03:39,285 --> 01:03:40,975
As always, trust me.

316
01:03:41,781 --> 01:03:42,413
Good.

317
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:02,126
How much will you give me?

318
01:05:01,332 --> 01:05:03,155
Who will buy this woman?

319
01:05:04,181 --> 01:05:05,490
No... she's too old.

320
01:05:06,773 --> 01:05:08,497
She can be useful.

321
01:05:08,981 --> 01:05:10,606
She can cook... clean...

322
01:05:12,085 --> 01:05:14,060
Useless old woman!

323
01:05:17,589 --> 01:05:19,051
No sale.

324
01:05:24,565 --> 01:05:25,874
Go!

325
01:05:26,933 --> 01:05:28,143
Go on.

326
01:10:16,628 --> 01:10:20,752
These are the days of our great lament.

327
01:10:25,045 --> 01:10:26,867
The land thirsts.

328
01:10:29,204 --> 01:10:33,427
A great plague infests our crops.

329
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:40,043
The scourge of sickness
afflicts us at whim.

330
01:10:45,813 --> 01:10:49,261
They say this strife has made us weak.

331
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,169
That we have become empty.

332
01:10:55,861 --> 01:10:58,032
They say that we rot.

333
01:11:09,268 --> 01:11:12,018
Great people of the banner of the sun...

334
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,227
I say...

335
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:17,104
... we are strong.

336
01:11:21,429 --> 01:11:23,403
We are a people of destiny.

337
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:31,152
Destined to be the masters of time.

338
01:11:35,061 --> 01:11:38,192
Destined to be nearest to the gods.

339
01:11:53,492 --> 01:11:56,492
Mighty Kukulkan!

340
01:11:58,068 --> 01:12:02,411
Whose fury could scorch
this earth to oblivion...

341
01:12:04,948 --> 01:12:07,152
Let us appease you with this sacrifice.

342
01:12:07,732 --> 01:12:09,456
To exalt you in your glory.

343
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:12,781
To make our people prosper.

344
01:12:13,844 --> 01:12:16,462
To prepare for your return.

345
01:12:19,412 --> 01:12:22,063
Warrior, unafraid and willing!

346
01:12:22,613 --> 01:12:24,849
With your blood you renew the world!

347
01:12:25,364 --> 01:12:27,088
From age to age.

348
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:30,029
Thanks be to you.

349
01:12:44,181 --> 01:12:46,253
The heart of god!

350
01:15:23,282 --> 01:15:25,454
Come back to me.

351
01:15:34,035 --> 01:15:35,824
Brother...

352
01:15:37,651 --> 01:15:39,374
Journey well...

353
01:15:41,459 --> 01:15:42,320
No.

354
01:15:43,763 --> 01:15:44,843
I can't go.

355
01:15:46,322 --> 01:15:47,817
Not now...

356
01:18:01,842 --> 01:18:06,479
People of the banner
of the sun do not fear.

357
01:18:07,379 --> 01:18:09,135
Rejoice!

358
01:18:10,355 --> 01:18:13,257
Kukulkan has drunk his fill of blood.

359
01:18:13,618 --> 01:18:16,302
We have sated his thirst.

360
01:18:17,395 --> 01:18:19,021
Great god.

361
01:18:19,955 --> 01:18:22,093
Show us that you are pleased.

362
01:18:22,354 --> 01:18:25,802
Let your light return upon us.

363
01:19:28,498 --> 01:19:30,473
What of these captives?

364
01:19:34,995 --> 01:19:36,817
Dispose of them.

365
01:20:09,843 --> 01:20:11,915
I need a finisher.

366
01:20:16,754 --> 01:20:17,998
You.

367
01:20:23,859 --> 01:20:25,353
Release them.

368
01:20:33,299 --> 01:20:34,859
You watch.

369
01:20:54,898 --> 01:20:55,913
I'm ready!

370
01:21:00,723 --> 01:21:03,570
There's your jungle beyond the corn.

371
01:21:06,418 --> 01:21:07,760
Go to it.

372
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:09,904
You're free...

373
01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:13,008
... now run.

374
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:17,487
I said run.

375
01:21:21,715 --> 01:21:22,925
Run!

376
01:22:33,555 --> 01:22:34,602
Not bad.

377
01:22:52,018 --> 01:22:53,295
Your turn.

378
01:23:00,818 --> 01:23:02,280
Run.

379
01:24:15,059 --> 01:24:16,465
Run!

380
01:25:27,923 --> 01:25:29,417
Sleep.

381
01:25:30,355 --> 01:25:32,493
Sleep, sleep now my son.

382
01:25:33,522 --> 01:25:35,759
The pain will be no more.

383
01:25:37,650 --> 01:25:38,860
Sleep.

384
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:16,650
He didn't come this way.

385
01:31:29,394 --> 01:31:31,282
He's in the trees.

386
01:31:32,978 --> 01:31:34,156
Spread out.

387
01:31:34,994 --> 01:31:36,456
Keep your eyes up.

388
01:31:57,938 --> 01:31:58,953
Quiet.

389
01:32:10,098 --> 01:32:11,243
He's coming right at us.

390
01:32:27,282 --> 01:32:27,914
There!

391
01:34:21,297 --> 01:34:23,916
He would have wanted me to have it.

392
01:34:26,002 --> 01:34:28,816
The omen is bad...

393
01:34:30,674 --> 01:34:33,609
Mighty Ek Chuah we beg you...

394
01:34:34,833 --> 01:34:38,892
Forgive us for this trespass
against your son the Jaguar.

395
01:34:40,818 --> 01:34:43,207
The omen is bad...

396
01:34:44,881 --> 01:34:46,769
Lift yourself up Drunkards Four...

397
01:34:47,602 --> 01:34:50,471
... the omen was foretold...

398
01:34:52,754 --> 01:34:55,820
... and now we have a fear more grave...

399
01:34:56,754 --> 01:35:00,016
... today I saw the day
become like night...

400
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:09,770
I saw a man run with the Jaguar...

401
01:35:13,522 --> 01:35:17,450
... we must not let this man
make feet from us.

402
01:35:18,162 --> 01:35:19,274
Enough.

403
01:35:22,898 --> 01:35:24,686
Your words mean nothing.

404
01:35:26,002 --> 01:35:28,141
He runs because he is afraid.

405
01:35:29,457 --> 01:35:32,938
When I catch him,
I will peel his skin...

406
01:35:35,858 --> 01:35:38,476
... and have him watch me wear it.

407
01:35:45,873 --> 01:35:47,051
We leave now.

408
01:37:49,457 --> 01:37:50,602
Stay back.

409
01:38:58,641 --> 01:38:59,721
Here!

410
01:39:23,281 --> 01:39:25,321
The omen was bad...

411
01:39:28,882 --> 01:39:29,962
He's fucked.

412
01:39:33,137 --> 01:39:34,479
Help... please...

413
01:39:35,281 --> 01:39:36,492
Hanging Moss...

414
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:39,658
See him out.

415
01:39:59,281 --> 01:40:02,794
Open your veins. It's quicker.

416
01:40:14,993 --> 01:40:17,001
Travel well.

417
01:43:15,217 --> 01:43:17,835
So much for your prophecies.

418
01:43:23,473 --> 01:43:24,651
It's not over!

419
01:43:49,617 --> 01:43:51,177
I am Jaguar Paw...

420
01:43:51,857 --> 01:43:53,351
Son of Flint Sky...

421
01:43:54,737 --> 01:43:57,966
My father hunted
this forest before me...

422
01:43:59,633 --> 01:44:01,520
My name is Jaguar Paw.

423
01:44:02,321 --> 01:44:03,848
I am a hunter.

424
01:44:05,393 --> 01:44:07,564
This is my forest.

425
01:44:08,689 --> 01:44:13,032
And my sons will hunt it
with their sons after I am gone...

426
01:44:15,793 --> 01:44:16,971
Come on!

427
01:44:19,537 --> 01:44:21,163
We are going over.

428
01:44:21,713 --> 01:44:24,331
We climb down around.

429
01:44:25,553 --> 01:44:27,560
We cannot let him get away.

430
01:44:28,241 --> 01:44:29,321
We cannot afford...

431
01:44:48,721 --> 01:44:50,760
We all jump.

432
01:47:40,529 --> 01:47:42,089
I am Jaguar Paw.

433
01:47:43,889 --> 01:47:45,645
This is my forest.

434
01:47:47,633 --> 01:47:50,219
And I am not afraid.

435
01:49:52,433 --> 01:49:54,888
You go. I'll wait here.

436
01:55:10,928 --> 01:55:12,652
Almost...

437
01:55:38,416 --> 01:55:41,002
Resting fathers, fly me your strength.

438
01:56:06,929 --> 01:56:08,620
Get up here.

439
01:56:22,897 --> 01:56:24,391
Go back!

440
01:56:52,592 --> 01:56:53,258
Quick!

441
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:54,768
Hurry up!

442
02:03:05,776 --> 02:03:07,565
What are they?

443
02:03:09,168 --> 02:03:10,924
They bring men.

444
02:03:15,376 --> 02:03:17,198
Should we go to them?

445
02:03:25,168 --> 02:03:26,891
We should go to the forest.

446
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,342
To seek a new beginning.
